This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Build and Deploy to AWS

Run `ng run build:serverless:deploy` to build the project, package it, and deploy
it to AWS. It creates a CloudFormation stack and a corresponding S3 bucket to host the code.
The CloudFormation stack creates the resources necessary for hosting the web application
as a serverless application. The URL is listed as the output to this command.

## Linting
Run `ng lint` to check the source code for best practices.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
